# Web-Programming
We create a fully fucntional website, mobile version included, in which logged in users have the opportunity to report road maintenance issues, using their phones, camera and its GPS location automatically. Admins of the website have access to the users database, such as e-mail or their reports
We use mySQL to setup the database, PHP,HTML,AJAX and javascript to setup the website.
